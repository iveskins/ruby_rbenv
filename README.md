# Usage

_Please read_

Example installations are provided in test/fixtures/cookbooks/test/recipes/

A `rbenv_system_install` or `rbenv_user_install` is required to be set so that rbenv knows which version you want to use, and is installed on the system.

## Gem

Used to install a gem into the selected rbenv environment.

```ruby
rbenv_gem 'gem_name' do
  options # Optional: Options to pass to the gem command e.g. '--no-rdoc --no-ri'
  source # Optional: source URL/location for gem.
  timeout # Optional: Gem install timeout
  version # Optional: Gem version to install
  response_file # Optional: response file to reconfigure a gem
  rbenv_version # Required: Which rbenv verison to install the gem to.
end
```

## Global

Sets the global ruby version. The name of the resource is the version to set.

```ruby
rbenv_global '2.3.4' do
  user # Optional: if passed sets the users global version. Leave unset, to set the system global version
end
```

If a user is passed in to this resource it sets the global version for the user, under the users root_path (usually `~/.rbenv/version`), otherwise it sets the system global version.

## Plugin

Installs a rbenv plugin.

```ruby
rbenv_plugin 'ruby-build' do
  git_url # Git URL of the plugin
  git_ref # Git reference of the plugin
  user # Optional: if passed installs to the users rbenv. Do not set, to set installs to the system rbenv.
end
```

If user is passed in, the plugin is installed to the users install of rbenv.

## Rehash

```ruby
rbenv_rehash 'rehash' do
  user 'vagrant' # Optional: if passed rehashes the user Ruby otherwise rehashes the system rbenv
end
```

If user is passed in, the user Ruby is rehashed rather than the system Ruby.

## Ruby

Installs a given Ruby version to the system or user location.

```ruby
rbenv_ruby '2.3.4' do
  user # Optional: If passed the user rbenv to install to
  rbenv_action # Optional: the action to perform, install, remove etc
end
```

Shorter example `rbenv_ruby '2.4.1'`

## Script

Runs a rbenv aware script.

```ruby
rbenv_script 'foo' do
  rbenv_version #rbenv version to run the script against
  environment # Optional: A Hash of environment variables in the form of ({"ENV_VARIABLE" => "VALUE"}).
  user # Optional: User to run as
  group # Optional: Group to run as
  returns # Optional: Expected return code
  code # Script code to run
end
```
Note that environment overwrites the entire variable.
For example. setting the $PATH variable can be done like this:
```ruby
rbenv_script 'bundle package' do
  cwd node["bundle_dir"]
  environment ({"PATH" => "/usr/local/rbenv/shims:/usr/local/rbenv/bin:#{ENV["PATH"]}"})
  code "bundle package --all"
end
```
Where `#{ENV["PATH"]}` appends the existing PATH to the end of the newly set PATH.


## System_install

Installs rbenv to the system location, by default `/usr/local/rbenv`

```ruby
rbenv_system_install 'foo' do
  git_url # URL of the plugin repo you want to checkout
  git_ref # Optional: Git reference to checkout
  update_rbenv # Optional: Keeps the git repo up to date
end
```

## User_install

Installs rbenv to the user path, making rbenv available to that user only.

```ruby
rbenv_user_install 'vagrant' do
  git_url # Optional: Git URL to checkout rbenv from.
  git_ref # Optional: Git reference to checkout e.g. 'master'
  user # Which user to install rbenv to (also specified in the resources name above)
end
```

## System-Wide Mac Installation Note

This cookbook takes advantage of managing profile fragments in an `/etc/profile.d` directory, common on most Unix-flavored platforms. Unfortunately, Mac OS X does not support this idiom out of the box, so you may need to [modify][mac_profile_d] your user profile.
